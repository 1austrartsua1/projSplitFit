## ProjSplitFit: Projective Splitting for Data Fitting Problems

This is an implementation of the projective splitting algorithm suitable for convec data fitting problems such as lasso and logistic regression. But it is highly flexible and may be applied to a wide variety of problems involving multiple regularizers and different types of loss functions including user-defined losses and regularizers.
